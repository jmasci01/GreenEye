As the world experiences the harsh impacts of climate change, water scarcity has become a pressing concern, particularly for countries like the U.S. Many industries that require extensive land maintenance are being adversely affected by the escalating cost of water, as well as state and federal regulations that limit water usage. In drought-prone regions, the golf industry has been hit hard, with some courses paying up to $2 million per year for water [9]. This steep rise in water costs has created a dire financial situation for golf course owners, forcing some courses to foreclose. EcoView Analytics (EVA) is offering GreenEye, a solution to alleviate the burden on golf courses and optimize their existing resources. GreenEye is an automated drone mapping system that employs our proprietary and patented hyperspectral imaging technology to analyze the course's health and generate a daily report that can be integrated with existing irrigation systems to enable precision irrigation.
With GreenEye, golf course owners can take charge of their water usage and reduce their environmental footprint. Our automated surveillance system enables course managers to water only the areas that require it, thus resulting in better control over labor and chemical usage, and increased operational efficiency for golf clubs. GreenEye empowers golf course owners to tackle the financial and environmental challenges posed by water scarcity, providing a path towards a more sustainable future.
